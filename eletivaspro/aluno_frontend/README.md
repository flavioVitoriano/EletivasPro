This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Quick start

1.  Make sure that you have Node.js v8.15.1 and npm v5 or above installed.
2.  Clone this repo using `git clone --depth=1 https://pedro-celestino@bitbucket.org/lixao/project-template-react.git <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>`
3.  Move to the appropriate directory: `cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>`.<br />
4.  Run `npm run setup` in order to install dependencies and clean the git repo.<br />
    _At this point you can run `npm start` to see the example app at `http://localhost:3000`._
5.  Run `npm run clean` to delete the example app.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run setup`

Initializes a new project with this boilerplate. Deletes the `project-template-react`
git history, installs the dependencies and initializes a new repository.

> Note: This command is self-destructive, once you've run it the init script is
> gone forever. This is for your own safety, so you can't delete your project's
> history irreversibly by accident.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run clean`

Deletes the example app, replacing it with the smallest amount of boilerplate
code necessary to start writing your app!

> Note: This command is self-destructive, once you've run it you cannot run it
> again. This is for your own safety, so you can't delete portions of your project
> irreversibly by accident.

### `npm run generate`

Allows you to auto-generate boilerplate code for common parts of your
application, specifically `component`s, and `container`s. You can
also run `npm run generate <part>` to skip the first selection. (e.g. `npm run generate container`)

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
